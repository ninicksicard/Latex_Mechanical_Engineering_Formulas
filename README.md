Latex_Mechanical_Engineering_Formulas

Following someone's idea of doing a Latex repository of mechanical engineering formulas(https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/6l16fn/machinereadable_repository_of_engineering/), I will begin to work with this format to allow quick organisation of equations into usefull cheatsheets. 

The goal of this repository is to create an easily readable repository of formulas, that has usefull attributes to allow management and organisation. Idealy, the structure would allow for dynamic link between variables and functions.  

The database includes for each formulas a latex equation, a name, a description, a cathegory and sub cathegories, a unique ID, a list of its common symbols, the ID of each other variables present in the equation, a standard numerical value if it exist, the units of every included variables. 

Title:Perfect gas constant, Description:the constant used in perfect gases equation, LatexSymbols:(R),ID:1600622509, value:8.31446261815324, Units:J⋅K−1⋅mol−1, etc...
